# Different ways in which you can pass parameters to functions

PRINT "Hello World"

# In expressions, parameters must be enclosed in parentheses:
x = UCASE$("foo")

# I've also made it such that :s interpret to NOOPs 
::::PRINT(x)

# At the statement level the parentheses are optional
# The second print should cause a blank line:
PRINT "vvvvv"
PRINT
PRINT "^^^^^"

# This line won't have a blank line before it because
# the PRINT: is taken to be a label named "print".
PRINT : PRINT "^^^ won't be blank"

# These would all work:
PRINT()
PRINT "^^^ should be blank"

PRINT() : PRINT "^^^ should be blank"

PRINT "" : PRINT "^^^ should be blank"

PRINT "A non blank line": PRINT "^^^ shouldn't be blank."
