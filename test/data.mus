# DATA() fills in "array" with some data.
# Its purpose is the same as the DATA statement in
# old BASICs, but it differs in how it achieves it.

# The @ operator creates a reference: DATA() expects as
# its first parameter the name of a variable to populate,
# and the @array basically converts to the string "array"
DATA(@array, "Alice", 2, "Carol")

# Subsequent calls to DATA() appends to the array:
DATA(@array, "Danny", 5, "Freddy")

# array['length'] contains the number of items
# in the array
PRINT("Length: ", array['length'])

# Bob and Eddie have been replaced by numbers 
# to show that DATA() doesn't care about the
# types of its parameters.
