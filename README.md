Musl
====

My Unstructured Scripting Language

Musl is my own small BASIC interpreter.

* Homepage: http://wstoop.co.za/?musl
* Source: http://github.com/wernsey/musl

(I recently discovered that there is an implementation of `libc` that
also goes by the name Musl. I will rename this project as soon as I can think up
a catchy name. Sorry for any confusion caused.)

The files in the distribution are:
* musl.c - The source code of the interpreter itself.
* musl.h - The header file, for using the interpreter in an application.
* main.c - The standalone interpreter. Also serves as a demonstration of
	how to embed the interpreter into an application.
* Makefile - The Makefile. To compile, simply type 'make'.
* doc.awk - Awk script that generates documentation from the comments in
    the source code.
* test/ - Directory full of test programs that demonstrates the syntax of
    the interpreter.

Part of the Makefile is to run the code through doc.awk which scans the
comments in the code for specific symbols from which an HTML file, manual.html,
is generated.

Mmmm, I'm going to have to rename the project. The name "Musl" is already
taken (http://www.musl-libc.org/intro.html)
